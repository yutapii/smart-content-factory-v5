Filip breaks down the architecture of these \"background agents,\" explaining how they use a reflection loop and tool-calling to execute complex tasks. He discusses the current limitations of agent protocols like MCPs and how developers can extend them to handle the required context and authority. The conversation challenges the idea that more powerful models lead to more autonomous agents, arguing instead for \"graceful recovery\" systems that proactively bring humans into the loop when the agent \"knows what it doesn't know.\" We also get into the \"application layer\" fight, exploring how SaaS platforms are creating data silos and what this means for the future of interoperable AI agents. Filip also shares his vision for the \"word artisan\"—the non-technical user who can now build and manage a fleet of AI agents, fundamentally changing the nature of knowledge work.\n\nThe complete show notes for this episode can be found at https://twimlai.com/go/741.",

      "content": "In this episode, Kwindla Kramer, co-founder and CEO of Daily and creator of the open source Pipecat framework, joins us to discuss the architecture and challenges of building real-time, production-ready conversational voice AI. Kwin breaks down the full stack for voice agents—from the models and APIs to the critical orchestration layer that manages the complexities of multi-turn conversations. We explore why many production systems favor a modular, multi-model approach over the end-to-end models demonstrated by large AI labs, and how this impacts everything from latency and cost to observability and evaluation. Kwin also digs into the core challenges of interruption handling, turn-taking, and creating truly natural conversational dynamics, and how to overcome them. We discuss use cases, thoughts on where the technology is headed, the move toward hybrid edge-cloud pipelines, and the exciting future of real-time video avatars, and much more.\n\nThe complete show notes for this episode can be found at https://twimlai.com/go/739.",

      "content": "Today, we're joined by Fatih Porikli, senior director of technology at Qualcomm AI Research for an in-depth look at several of Qualcomm's accepted papers and demos featured at this year’s CVPR conference. We start with “DiMA: Distilling Multi-modal Large Language Models for Autonomous Driving,” an end-to-end autonomous driving system that incorporates distilling large language models for structured scene understanding and safe planning motion in critical \"long-tail\" scenarios. We explore how DiMA utilizes LLMs' world knowledge and efficient transformer-based models to significantly reduce collision rates and trajectory errors. We then discuss “SharpDepth: Sharpening Metric Depth Predictions Using Diffusion Distillation,” a diffusion-distilled approach that combines generative models with metric depth estimation to produce sharp, accurate monocular depth maps. Additionally, Fatih also shares a look at Qualcomm’s on-device demos, including text-to-3D mesh generation, real-time image-to-video and video-to-video generation, and a multi-modal visual question-answering assistant.\n\nThe complete show notes for this episode can be found at https://twimlai.com/go/738.",

      "content": "Today, we're joined by Vijoy Pandey, SVP and general manager at Outshift by Cisco to discuss a foundational challenge for the enterprise: how do we make specialized agents from different vendors collaborate effectively? As companies like Salesforce, Workday, and Microsoft all develop their own agentic systems, integrating them creates a complex, probabilistic, and noisy environment, a stark contrast to the deterministic APIs of the past. Vijoy introduces Cisco's vision for an \"Internet of Agents,\" a platform to manage this new reality, and its open-source implementation, AGNTCY. We explore the four phases of agent collaboration—discovery, composition, deployment, and evaluation—and dive deep into the communication stack, from syntactic protocols like A2A, ACP, and MCP to the deeper semantic challenges of creating a shared understanding between agents. Vijoy also unveils SLIM (Secure Low-Latency Interactive Messaging), a novel transport layer designed to make agent-to-agent communication quantum-safe, real-time, and efficient for multi-modal workloads.\n\nThe complete show notes for this episode can be found at ⁠https://twimlai.com/go/737.",

We dig into the team’s end-to-end approach to leveraging AI in equities feature forecasting, covering how they identify and create features, collect and quantify historical data, and build predictive models to forecast market behavior and asset prices for trading and investment. We explore the firm's platform-centric approach to managing an extensive portfolio of features and models, the impact of multimodal LLMs on accelerating the process of extracting novel features, the importance of strict data timestamping to prevent temporal leakage, and the way they consider build vs. buy decisions in a rapidly evolving landscape. Lastly, Ben also shares insights on leveraging open-source models and the future of agentic AI in quantitative finance.\n\nThe complete show notes for this episode can be found at https://twimlai.com/go/736.",
